The support for the [Azure Functions plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions) was lacking (hadn't been a code commit in ~2 years), and there were several companies using Azure that were interesting in using the framework to deploy their workflows. Our team re-wrote the existing plugin to account for changes to Azure Functions and make the tool more robust for enterprise use. This has been one of my favorite projects that I have been involved in.\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n  - [My contributions](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+author%3Atbarlow12+) to the plugin\r\n  - [Contributor graph](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions/graphs/contributors)\r\n  - [My contributions](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions/graphs/contributors) to the core framework\r\n  - [Blog post](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-azure-functions-v1) for Serverless website\r\n\r\n### VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool)\r\n\r\n[VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT) is a popular open-source tool for the labeling of image and video data for computer vision model training.
