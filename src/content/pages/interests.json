{"content":"\r\n# Career Interests\r\n\r\nI've been really lucky to work on some really cool open-source developer/data scientist tools in my career such as [Cloud Custodian](https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian), [VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT) and the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless), specifically the [Azure Functions plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions). This has inspired a love both for open source and for helping developers be more productive.\r\n\r\nI'm fascinated by anything related to natural language understanding/processing. My first internship project was to create a recurring job that read through feedback from Windows users and determine which pieces of feedback are actionable, and then add those pieces of feedback to the backlog of the Windows dev team.\r\n\r\nAt some point in my career, I would love to use my talents and experience in software to improve the efficiency of the healthcare industry.\r\n\r\n# Personal Interests\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not writing code, I love hanging out with my best friend. She happens to also be my wife, so that works out pretty well. I also love playing cars, tag, hide-and-seek, wrestling, etc. with our two little boys, ages 2 and 3 months.\r\n\r\nI also love playing basketball and golf, eating cheeseburgers and binge-watching The Office for the 27th time through (with a healthy mix of Parks and Rec). I can quote The Sandlot start to finish, and can rattle off most of John Stockton's career stat line.","data":{"title":"Interests","path":"/interests"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}
