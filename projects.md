- [Learn It Your Way](https://github.com/tbarlow12/Learn-It-Your-Way)

The documents also could have categories, keywords, titles, authors and other features. I implemented this lightweight desktop application in Java to quickly search by any of those attributes. She gave it the name AskD in honor of her own name.
