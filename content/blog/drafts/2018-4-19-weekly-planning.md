title: My Weekly Planning---

I know what you're thinking. This guy is going to tell me I've been planning my week all wrong and that he has some "secret sauce" that will make me 1000x more productive... Well, I won't. If you find that secret sauce, let me know. 

It's been my experience that effective planning can be as different as the people that are doing it. I've just found a system that works for me in my career as a software engineer. Feel free to cherry pick anything from my experience that you feel may help, but make it your own.

Every Friday afternoon, when there doesn't seem to be a lot going on, I block out an hour of my time to plan the upcoming week. It almost never takes that long, but it's nice to have the time blocked out if I do need it.

## Task Tracking & Planning Tool: [Trello](https://trello.com/)

Trello is my go-to for task tracking and I have separate boards for work and personal tasks. I've experimented with several different styles of lists, such as the traditional Kanban lists of **To-Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**. I find that it works great for team projects/backlogs, but when it makes it hard to plan for a week.

Instead, I'm using a list layout I'm using now was mostly taken from [John Sonmez's video on weekly planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9k0OhJkjQ0), where he has a list for **Today**, a list for **Completed**, a list for **each day of the week**, a list for **This Week**, **Next Week**, and a list for **Later**. 

On Friday afternoon, I sit down and look at the list of tasks I have for the coming week and schedule them for a certain day of the week by moving their card into that list.

Here's where it gets a little more interesting. I wrote a script that runs every morning at 1:00 AM to move things around in my lists (each day's cards -> **Today**, **Next Week** -> **This Week** on Sunday morning, etc.). It may be a little overkill, but it wasn't hard, I can't help but write code the automation lets me not worry about moving things around each morning. 

I have the Trello mobile app on my Android phone with a widget for my **Today** list on my home screen. So rather than seeing notification badges for how many likes my latest Insta post just got, I am looking at exactly what I have planned to do for that day.

## Time-Boxing Tool: [Pomello](https://pomelloapp.com/)

[Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique for time-boxing, in which work time is broken down into 25-minute increments, separated by short breaks. [Pomello](https://pomelloapp.com/) is a desktop tool that pulls tasks from a Trello list, runs the timer for the tasks and logs the time in the Trello cards.

Because my planned tasks for each day are automatically moved to the **Today** list, I never have to change the list in Pomello, and I can track the time for the tasks I have planned for each day.

Planning is the easy part. But if there's not a good way to execute that plan and track the execution of that plan, planning can be a waste of time.
