## Intro

I've been experimenting and researching for years on how to best manage my personal tasks. It's something that I love reading and thinking about. 

I'm hesitant to write this post, just because I don't want it to come off as prescriptive in any way.

## Favorite Books on the Subject

Many of my [favorite books](../../pages/books.md) I've read recently are about productivity. But the core of my personal system can basically be found in these books:

- [The Productivity Project]()
- [Hyperfocus]()
- [Getting Things Done]()

## Methodology

I don't pretend to be a productivity expert. But I have learned what things work for me and what things do not. For me, it boils down to __ key pieces

1. Capture - Make it easy to capture thoughts, ideas, impressions
2. Process - Find the right home
3. Purposeful Planning
4. Act - Right place, right time (gif of johnny depp, opportune moment)

### Weekly Planning

In [The Productivity Project](), Chris Bailey talks about "hotspots." These are the high-level pieces that make up your life. I won't go into too much detail about it here, but basically by having these predefined categories of things in your life, it can give you greater peace of mind knowing you're not completely neglecting an important part of your life. I go through these categories in my weekly planning and generate tasks if there is "something I forgot to remember." For example, I have a `Relationships` hotspot, which makes me take time to

### Daily Planning

## Tools

### Trello

I discovered Trello in college and I fell in love with it. I've always loved physical "sticky-note task boards." I think it is a very clear and concise way to see and update the stages of each task's lifecycle. However, this can be a challenge if you `a)` don't have a dedicated space to put your task board, or `b)` you or your teammates work in different places. Both of those conditions have described my experience in school and in work.

I think Trello has created a product that makes you feel as close to a "sticky-note task board" as it gets. It's genuinely fun to use and man, is it satisfying to move those cards around. I've played around with many other ideas for managing my tasks - hierarchical lists, flat lists, GitHub issues/notes on GitHub projects, Azure DevOps stories w/ sub tasks, and many, many more. I do think that all of these tools have their place for certain use cases. 

However, for me, I really enjoy being able to have all my tasks in one place while still being able to organize those tasks into discrete buckets. My Trello board basically has the following layout:

- Today
- This Week
- Done
- Triage
- Waiting For
- *...Categories*
- Things I'd like to do

Here's an explanation of what these lists do for me:

`Today` - I keep my `Today` list front and center because that's what I've committed to do today. The `Today` list is the first list I can see if I open the Trello app on my phone, and my eyes naturally go to the left side of the screen on my laptop. This, to me, is the most important list because if I'm not actually *doing* something *today*, what's the point in planning at all?

Each morning during my daily planning, I scan my `Triage` list to make sure everything is put where it needs to be (especially if I captured any urgent tasks that belong in the `Today` list). I then go through my `This Week` list to determine which tasks I'm going to bite off that day. 

`This Week` - Each week, in my weekly planning, I take time to scan each of my list categories to see if there is anything urgent I need to get done... this week. By taking the time to go through each list during my weekly planning, I'm giving myself the peace and assurance that I won't miss anything critical while not forcing myself to scan *all* lists every single morning.

`Done` - This, perhaps to your great surprise, holds the tasks that are done. In the past, I've just archived the card when it's done, but I found that I get a lot more joy out of moving the card over to the done column than letting it disappear in to the digital void. Plus, at the end of the week, I have a [Butler]() policy (you'll read more about this later) in place to generate a report of everything that I did during the week, send me an email with the results and then ceremoniously archive each card to clear space for the coming week. It's magical.

`Triage` - This is the birthplace of all my tasks. If I have a quick thought while I'm on the go, I actually have a widget on my phone (thank you Android) that lets me tap once and type in the task and sends it directly to my `Triage` list. If there are tasks that come up that I *know* are urgent and must get done either today or this week, I'll just put them directly in the appropriate list. By having this one place where all the ideas are collected, I can be sure that I'm not missing a captured idea just because it's hidden in the bottom of one of my categorical lists. It also forces me to prioritize incoming tasks on at least a daily basis.

`Waiting For` - Nothing generates more sub-conscious frustration for me than to see a task in my list that I can do nothing about. By having a landing spot for tasks that require an action/event outside of my control, I can let my mind rest, knowing that I've done all that I can. This list is also scanned during my morning planning just in case that action/event has happened and I can move forward to finishing the task.

`Categorical Lists` - I used to just have one long backlog of tasks that got prioritized each week. I switched to keeping categorical lists for two reasons:

1. More **compartmentalization**. I really like to be able to focus on the thing I want to focus on when I want to focus on that thing. If I can look at one list that contains all my pending tasks for that context (outside of the tasks that need to be done today or this week), it just makes me feel warm inside.
2. Just in case I'm in the **"right place, right time"** to do a task that I didn't necessarily plan on. For example, I have an `Errands` list. If I'm out and about with my two little boys and want to give my wife a little extra time to just sit in peace without a baby in her arms or a toddler climbing all over her, I'll pull up the list and see if there is anything we can go do together.

To make sure these categories are not lost as the tasks move through the different lists, I have [Butler]() policies (again, you'll read more about this later... stop trying to read ahead) that automatically apply the appropriate label to cards as they are moved into the list. This gives me the capability of filtering my entire board to see only tasks with that label, even if they are no longer in their categorical list. For example, when I'm at work, it's nice to see tasks that I'm doing `This Week` or `Today` without having to scan through the other tasks in those lists.

### Pomello

[Pomello]() is my "runtime" task management tool. My trusted companion on the battlefield of daily productivity. She keeps me accountable, focused and in the zone.

You may be familiar with the [Pomodoro]() system. If not, it's basically 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. Do four of those cycles, and take a longer break. Pomello takes the Pomodoro system and applies it to my Trello tasks. When you start it up for the first time, you log into your Trello account. Then, you pick a list to work off of. Mine is the `Today` list if you didn't guess that already. Pomello then asks you to pick a task and has an extremely satisfying "clock winding up" sound that plays when you start a new task. The timer runs for 25 minutes, and Pomello will actually log on your Trello card how many (even fractional) Pomodoros you've spent working on that task. I love it because it keeps me focused on what I'm working on and forces me to time-box the work that I do. If a task requires more than 3 or 4 Pomodoros, I probably should've broken it down a little bit more.

### Butler

At last, you've made it to the section you've been waiting for. It's been a long, rough journey through these last few paragraphs... but we made it. 

(congratulations gif)

[Butler]() was originally developed as a 3rd party Trello add-in, but was recently acquired by Trello itself. It's a 

### My Own Version

Not to be salty, but I actually built a less extensible, harder-to-use and less popular version of Butler a little while ago without even knowing that Butler existed... so we'll just say they stole my idea. Mine was called [TaskBoardAssistant]() (catchy name, right?). Basically it was a concise way to define policies that would ideally be run on a timer trigger, usually from a serverless environment (Azure Functions in my case). It allowed users to create a `.yml` file that contained the filters and actions for different Trello entities (move these cards to this list, create these tasks every morning, etc.).

Originally, [TaskBoardAssistant]() was meant to be bigger than just Trello. In my work at Microsoft, we use a lot of different incarnations of "task boards" such as GitHub projects and Azure DevOps (the artist formerly known as Visual Studio Online). I wanted one policy to rule them all... Something that would copy stories/tasks/issues assigned to me in either GitHub or AzDO and then bring them to my Trello board where I was most comfortable interacting with them. The project is still there, and maybe someday I'll contribute more to it. But since I discovered Butler and IFTTT (foreshadowing), it seems like the most likely path of adoption is within those ecosystems.

 It ended up being mostly just automation for Trello entities has __ stars on GitHub and had at least one user... me.

### IFTTT

If you can't tell already, I *love* automation (to an extent).

### Google Keep

You can think of Google Keep as my RAM of ideas. Any time a thought pops into my head that I want to make sure I capture, it's a simple tap away from the widget on my phone.

(screenshot)

Google Keep only really has 3 "stages" a note can be in: a normal note, a pinned note, and an archived note. For that reason, I don't like to keep notes in there for a long time. It tends to make me feel scattered and unorganized. Instead, I try to clear out all of my notes each week during my weekly planning. Often times these notes lead to action items for my Trello board, other times they are just thoughts, impressions or ideas that I want to make sure I hold onto. That's where OneNote comes into play 👇.

### OneNote

OneNote acts as my long-term storage. I love the ability it gives me to compartmentalize things into notebooks, sections, pages, and even sub-pages. Everything is searchable (even the handwriting pages from notes I've taken on my Surface), which makes it great if I can remember just a word or two from the note I'm looking for. I don't think the mobile app is as snappy as Google Keep. There's a pretty significant delay in start-up at times and that can be pretty crucial when I'm trying to capture a fleeting idea. Plus, it's pretty easy for things to be hidden deep inside the caverns of compartmentalization I mentioned above. For that reason, I don't like it to be my "bucket" for new ideas. It's more a final resting ground for the ideas once I've been able to find them a home that makes sense.

## Conclusion

Many of you (as if there were "many" people reading this blog) may think that this system is overkill. There may be others who feel that this is not enough. But that's the point... You don't have to agree with/adopt this style. You can take a piece or two or nothing at all for your own system. It can be whatever you want it to be. I only share what I do in the hopes that a small strategy or tool that has worked for me might work well for you too.
