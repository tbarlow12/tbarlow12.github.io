I don't pretend to be a productivity expert. I can't tell you the ins and outs of why the brain does what it does, nor the optimal strategy for scheduling interdependent tasks. I can't put together a flawless Gantt chart or even run a "perfectly Agile" Scrum meeting. But I have spent a lot of time getting things done. I've turned in thousands of homework assignments, written even more thousands of lines of code, paid my bills on-time and even manage to find time to be with my family. Like you, I juggle many different balls and do my best not to drop any of them.

I'm hesitant to write this post, just because I don't want it to come off as prescriptive in any way. I'm a strong believer that, when it comes to productivity, people should find whatever works best for them, and then do it. Often times, what works best for me is different than what works best for someone else. I've been experimenting and researching for years on how to best manage my own tasks, and I thought I'd share some of what works for me.

These tools, tips and practices have simply been a structure I've put in place over the years, not only to make sure I don't miss something, but to allow myself to feel the peace and freedom that comes with *knowing* I won't miss anything. I have learned (and am still learning) what things work for me and what things do not. For me, it boils down to 4 key pieces:

1. `Gotta Catch 'em all` - Make it as easy as possible to capture thoughts, ideas and tasks.
2. `A place for everything and everything in its place` - Process those captured thoughts to put them in where I know I'll see it when I can do something about it.
3. `Plan with Purpose` - Decide how I will spend my time before it decides for me.
4. `Do the most important thing` - Perform each task in the right place at the right time.

I'll go through each of the four points and discuss some of the tools and tricks that work for me. If you like an idea, great. Use it. If you don't like an idea, great. Don't use it.

Before I jump into talking about each phase in my task management process, let me introduce my good friend [Trello](https://www.trello.com). 

## 1. Gotta Catch 'em All

One of the largest challenges for getting things done is capturing and staying on top of tasks from all their different sources. (external and internal???)

One of the most important things for me to feel organized is to consolidate all my tasks into **one place**. This allows me to appropriately prioritize and gives me the peace of mind that there is not something, somewhere that I'm forgetting.

Many of my most valuable thoughts and ideas come at unexpected times and might not last very long. If I don't capture the idea quickly, I might not ever get it at all. But I've noticed that I don't need to capture the *entire* thought every time. For any of you familiar with how memory in a computer works, I'm not afraid of losing the *data* I've allocated in the memory of my brain, I'm afraid of losing the *pointer* to that chunk of memory. So, I have tools in place that allow me to quickly and easily capture pointers to those thoughts so I can go access that idea and act on it later on.

If you can't tell already, I *love* automation (to an extent).

## Favorite Books on the Subject

Many of my [favorite books](/#/books) I've read recently are about productivity. But the core of my personal system can basically be found in these books:

- [The Productivity Project]()
- [Atomic Habits]()
- [Hyperfocus]()
- [Getting Things Done]()

## Methodology






### Weekly Planning

In [The Productivity Project](), Chris Bailey talks about "hotspots." These are the high-level pieces that make up your life. I won't go into too much detail about it here, but basically by having these predefined categories of things in your life, it can give you greater peace of mind knowing you're not completely neglecting an important part of your life. I go through these categories in my weekly planning and generate tasks if there is "something I forgot to remember." For example, I have a `Relationships` hotspot, which makes me take time to

## Conclusion

Many of you (as if there were "many" people reading this blog) may think that this system is overkill. There may be others who feel that this is not enough. But that's the point... You don't have to agree with/adopt this style. You can take a piece or two or nothing at all for your own system. It can be whatever you want it to be. I only share what I do in the hopes that a small strategy or tool that has worked for me might work well for you too.
