title: My Six Rights - Core Values I Hold as a Software Engineer

path: corevalues

Recently, our team lead presented the core values he holds as an engineer, and standards for which he wanted our team to strive.
It caused me to reflect on what my personal values are as a software engineer, so in order to fully flesh them out for myself, I decided I'd write them down.

I listed principles and ideas that have been important for me in my career.
After looking at the list, there were a few groups that started to take shape.
Once those groups were formed, I tried to name the groups with what felt like the least common denominator between them, and I started noticing another pattern in those names - the word "right" kept appearing.

Because I'm a sucker for alliteration, acronyms and any kind of mnemonic device, I decided to name this list my **"Six Rights"**:

- Treat People Right
- Use the Right Tool
- Build the Right Thing
- Code the Right Way
- Do the Right Thing Right Now
- Make Time to Right the Ship

For the most astute among you, you'll notice that there are actually seven "rights" in that list.
It seemed like "Seven Rights" would've been more confusing for people who only counted six bullet points, so we'll split the difference and think of it as "The Baker's Half-Dozen Rights" because of the bonus "right" you got near the end there.
Not officially, because that's ridiculous.
Just between you and me.

Each of these values are pretty broad for interpretation, so I'll do my best to explain what they mean to me.
As mentioned before, each value is a summation of other values that seemed to fit together, so I'll try to call those out as well.

## Treat People Right

The rest of these are not necessarily in any kind of order, but this one is very intentionally placed at the top of the list.
People should come before everything else we do in this industry.

When I became a software engineer, friends and family assumed that it meant I'd be a anti-social recluse, working in my pajamas in a dark basement.
While that may be what all the movies depict, it's actually not true at all (it became partially true during the pandemic, but that's neither here nor there).

I spend a huge portion of my day communicating with and working alongside *people* (at least the ones we have yet to replace with artificial intelligence).

We could write volumes about what it means to "treat people right."
We'd likely venture into some interesting moral, philosophical and/or religious discussions.
For our purposes here, I'd like to share what I think it means to "treat people right" in the context of a software engineering team.

Software engineering is very much a team sport.
