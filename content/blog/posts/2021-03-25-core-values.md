Recently, our team lead presented the core values he holds as an engineer, and standards for which he wanted our team to strive for.
It caused me to reflect on what my personal values are as a software engineer, so in order to fully flesh them out for myself, I decided I'd write them down.
So here are my own core values as a software engineer:

## Use the Right Tool

## Build the Right Thing

## Code the Right Way

## Do the Right Thing Right Now

## Treat People Right

## Right the Ship
