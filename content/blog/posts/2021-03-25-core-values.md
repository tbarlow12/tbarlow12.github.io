title: My Six Rights - Core Values I Hold as a Software Engineer
date: 2021-3-25
path: corevalues

Recently, our team lead presented the core values he holds as an engineer, and standards for which he wanted our team to strive.
It caused me to reflect on what my personal values are as a software engineer, so in order to fully flesh them out for myself, I decided I'd write them down.

I listed principles and ideas that have been important for me in my career.
After looking at the list, there were a few groups that started to take shape.
Once those groups were formed, I tried to name the groups with what felt like the least common denominator between them, and I started noticing another pattern in those names - the word "right" kept appearing.

Because I'm a sucker for alliteration, acronyms and any kind of mnemonic device, I decided to name this list my **"Six Rights"**:

- Treat People Right
- Use the Right Tool
- Build the Right Thing
- Code the Right Way
- Do the Right Thing Right Now
- Make Time to Right the Ship

For the most astute among you, you'll notice that there are actually seven "rights" in that list.
It seemed like "Seven Rights" would've been more confusing for people who only counted six bullet points, so we'll split the difference and think of it as "The Baker's Half-Dozen Rights" because of the bonus "right" you got near the end there.
Not officially, because that's ridiculous.
Just between you and me.

Each of these values are pretty broad for interpretation, so I'll do my best to explain what they mean to me.
As mentioned before, each value is a summation of other values that seemed to fit together, so I'll try to call those out as well.

## Treat People Right

The rest of these are not necessarily in any kind of order, but this one is very intentionally placed at the top of the list.
People should come before everything else we do in this industry.

When I became a software engineer, friends and family assumed that it meant I'd be a anti-social recluse, working in my pajamas in a dark basement.
While that may be what all the movies depict, it's actually not true at all (it became partially true during the pandemic, but that's neither here nor there).

I spend a huge portion of my day communicating with and working alongside *people* (at least the ones we have yet to replace with artificial intelligence).

We could write volumes about what it means to "treat people right."
We'd likely venture into some interesting moral, philosophical and/or religious discussions.
For our purposes here, I'd like to share what I think it means to "treat people right" in the context of a software engineering team.

### Assume Good Intent

In a good team, there are bound to be differences of opinion.
That's kind of the point.
We discuss things, bounce ideas off each other, debate between alternatives and somehow, make decisions as a team.
With these differences of opinion, it can be easy to get

### Trust and Be Trustworthy

While "zero trust" may be a good strategy when it comes to security practices, it can destroy an engineering team.
Trust is a pre-requisite to honest and open communication.

Trust is a two-way street.
If you expect your teammates to trust that you have their back, you need to really have their back.

This kind of trust doesn't necessarily mean you have the 2-weeks-out-of-college new hire approving builds for production.
It means replacing

### Bring Others Along

### Review Code With Empathy

I talked about this in [one of my other posts](https://tannerbarlow.com/#/blog/mistakes), so I won't go into too much detail here.
Bottom line - yes, we need to be honest and clear when providing a code review, but that does not mean we assume we work with morons.

Rather than attacking or berating the author, **ask questions**.
Not only will it help you gather the context you may be missing, but if it is indeed a mistake on the author's part, it will help the author teach themself as they answer your question.
If necessary, suggest to hop on a call or grab a conference room to walk through some of your thoughts.

We've *all* opened up a crappy pull request.
And if you haven't, yes you have.
Be kind.
Assume you may not have all the facts.
Invest in your teammate's growth and learning by building them up rather than tearing them down.

### Lead With Compassion

## Use the Right Tool

As engineers, we don't write code exclusively `0`s and `1`s anymore.
Everything we do is using *some* kind of tool.
Languages, frameworks, design patterns, PaaS offerings, and the list goes on.
It is important that we are using the *right tool* for the *right job*.

### No Silver Bullets

A "silver bullet," metaphorically speaking, is something that can be applied almost magically to any problem - anytime, anywhere.
For those of my generation, the term "[golden gun](https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Gun)" may be more appropriate here.

It's important that we don't pigeon hole too deep on any one particular tool.
There will be some tools that will be great for some problems, and other tools that might be great for others.
Part of our job as engineers is to evaluate the trade-offs between the various tools and make a decision on which to use for our current problem.
Because this industry is changing at break-neck speed, we will need to stay up-to-date on the state of the art for the problem space we're working in, which leads me to...
