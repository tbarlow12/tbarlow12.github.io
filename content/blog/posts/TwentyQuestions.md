Hi, I'm Tanner Barlow. I'm a software engineer on the Commercial Software Engineering team at Microsoft. I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, where I also attended school at the University of Utah (Go Utes!). I majored in Computer Science and helped start the school's first ever hackathon, HackTheU, with a few of my friends. I was asked to answer 20 questions regarding my experience working at Microsoft and what it's like to live in the great Pacific Northwest. If either of these topics interest you (primarily the first), read on.

## 1.	How are using Microsoft as a platform from your passions?

I get to work on some pretty cool open-source projects at work. I get to work on a broad range of technologies and tools, spanning the stack. Our team does some traveling, so I bring my family on a lot of my work trips and often extend my stay to explore the different parts of the world we visit. We meet and work alongside other software engineers from all over the world. Our management encourages 20% projects (relevant side projects you work on with 20% of your time), some of which have actually evolved into open-source projects that we‚Äôve worked on and contributed to. I've been able to attend a few conferences (our team sends us to one conference per year if we want to go).

## 2.	What is your favorite building on campus and why?

The Mixer ‚Äì basically any kind of food you could want and a basketball court right outside. 

## 3.	What's the most challenging part of your job?

Constant change and needing to learn radically different tools & technologies in a short period of time. Our team works on a pretty broad range of stuff. For example, in the last year, I went from working on Cloud Custodian (Python) to working on VoTT (TypeScript, Electron, React) to working on the Azure Functions plugin for the Serverless Framework (TypeScript, Node) with a few small projects sprinkled in between.

## 4. Myth or Not: Do you have to be an intern to secure a full-time role? 

MYTH. Of the 10 members on my team, 2 of us were interns at Microsoft. I loved my experience for two summers as an intern at Microsoft, but it's definitely not a requirement.

## 5. Interview Prep 101, what is the best resource you would recommend?

Cracking the Coding Interview + LeetCode + Pramp

## 6.	What's one piece of career/personal advice you'd give you your younger self?

Get up early and get things done before the rest of the day makes demands on your time. The first hour of my day is reserved for only the most important things, and it makes the rest of my day go so much better.

## 7.	What are ways that you feel empowered to give back to communities and how? 

The donation matching + volunteer time matching ($25/hr) from Microsoft is an amazing benefit that I‚Äôve used to give back to a local Boy Scout troop I‚Äôve volunteered with.

## 8. How did you decide to work at MSFT vs. another company? 

MSFT seemed more family-friendly than most of the companies I was interviewing with (I'm writing this in the middle of my 12 weeks of paternity leave). I felt like I could really grow in CSE, and I felt like there were a lot of people around me that would help me learn. Microsoft is huge, and I like the flexibility of being able to switch what I'm working on without leaving the company (Not happening any time soon, CSE is way too much fun). I also really identified with the vision of ‚Äúempowering others‚Äù from Microsoft's mission statement.

## 9. Who are your mentors? How did you select/build a relationship with mentor?  

I have several mentors, but as I mentioned above, one of the reasons I picked Microsoft (and specifically, CSE) was because I felt like there were a lot of engineers that were willing and able to teach me. I get to work side by side with some of the smartest software engineers I've met, and I've learned a lot from them. One of my mentors is a manager on a peer team. We met on his first day joining the group at Microsoft's annual company-wide hackathon, and at the time, I was still trying to decide on whether or not to rejoin Microsoft after graduating. He gave me some sage wisdom and taught me more in those 3 days of coding side-by-side than I had learned in weeks of working in my day job. I decided that if I can work with people like that every day, that's a place I want to be. Since joining the team, we grab coffee (or hot chocolate for us non-coffee drinkers) every 2-3 weeks to chat about whatever‚Äôs going on in work and in life. He's got a lot of experience and knowledge to share, and I'm grateful to be able to benefit from it. Other mentors include my parents, church leaders and previous managers from my intern days at MSFT.

## 10. In a quick snapshot, what do you do?

Simply put, I write code with dev teams of Microsoft partners. For 3-5 months, our team pairs up with one of their dev teams and solve whatever interesting problem they are confronting at the time. This usually includes traveling to wherever they are in the world at least once. Because these companies all use some open-source tooling at some place in their stack, we do a lot of work on strategic open-source projects to support these efforts.

## 11. In your mind, what makes a great software engineer?

Grit, resourcefulness and humility. With those three things, most of the other skills can be acquired over time.

## 12. What does a typical day look like as a software engineer? How much time do you spend coding? In meetings? etc. What is the size of your team? How does your manager contribute to your overall success? 

My day starts early, I usually roll into the office around 5:45. I save the first few precious hours of solitude in the office strictly for writing, reading and reviewing code. The rest of my team trickles in throughout the morning, and we'll usually have standup around 10. These standup calls are often conference calls with another dev team somewhere else in the world, so that may be adjusted depending on their time zone. Aside from standup, there's usually one or two other meetings at some point throughout the day, and we do a lot of impromptu meetings to discuss design or feedback from a code review. Our team has 10 engineers, but we‚Äôre often split in 2 or 3 squads depending on the projects we have going at the time. My manager is actually right there in the weeds with us ‚Äì coding alongside us just like other devs on the team. He does a great job of making sure we all have opportunities to stretch and grow.

## 13. Can you give me more insight into internal mobility? (i.e. how common is it to move teams, how did you do it? Does the power of networking really work?) 

I worked as an intern in the Windows organization for 2 years, and joined this team when I came on full-time. Not a difficult change, I just talked to a manager a few times and did the OneWeek hackathon with him and a few others on his team to see if it would be a good fit. It was üòä

## 14. If you were a former intern, what was your intern project?

I interned for two summers, and my projects were 1) Automating identification of actionable feedback from Windows users using an internal NLP tool and 2) K-means clustering pipeline of windows users based on telemetry received from their machine.

## 15. If you weren‚Äôt a Software Engineer/Program Manager, what would you be?

Either the Assistant to the Regional Manager of a local paper supply company or an architect at Vandelay Industries.

## 16. What is your favorite caf√©/restaurant in the Seattle area?

Well, we live in Everett, so I'll go with Chops (Bulgorrito‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like)

## 17. What is something that you do outside of work to re-energize?

Cook with my wife, play basketball with my friends, play with my 2 sons (ages 2 and 1 week), binge watch The Office or Parks and Rec.

## 18. Describe your ideal day in Seattle?

Summer day on the beach (probably Jetty Island) with my family. Ride the bus into Seattle for a Mariners game, complete with a Seattle dog, garlic fries and post-game fireworks

## 19. What's your favorite way to eat a potato?

Sliced up and fried into 3-5 inch cubic strands of pure goodness. Otherwise known as french fries. Preferably next to a burger. Preferably from Dick‚Äôs drive in

## 20. If you had a superpower, what would it be and why?

Sleep Manipulation (think Mantis from Avengers) so that I could make my kids sleep when they're supposed to. Either that or flight.
