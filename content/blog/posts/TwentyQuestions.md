My former university recruiter asked me and a few other engineers to answer a few questions about what it's like to work at Microsoft. Here are my answers:

## Intro:

`Name:` Tanner Barlow <br>
`Hometown:` Salt Lake City, Utah <br>
`Alma Mater:` University of Utah <br>
`Team/role:` Commercial Software Engineering, Software Engineer <br>
`Fun‚ÄØquestion/fact:` My high school mascot is a "beetdigger"
 
<!-- Microsoft Culture  -->
### 1.	How are using Microsoft as a platform from your passions?

I get to write open-source code at work. I've been able to attend a few conferences (our team sends us to one conference per year if we want). I bring my family on most work trips and often extend my stay to explore the different parts of the world we visit. Our management encourages 20% projects (relevant side projects you work on with 20% of your time), some of which have actually evolved into open source projects that we‚Äôve worked on and contributed to.

### 2.	What is your favorite building on campus and why?

The Mixer ‚Äì basically any kind of food you could want and a basketball court right outside. 

### 3.	What's the most challenging part of your job?

Constant change and needing to learn radically different tools & technologies in a short period of time

### 4. Myth or Not: Do you have to be an intern to secure a full-time role? 

MYTH. There are SO many people on my team that never interned anywhere. I was an intern, and loved my experience, but wasn‚Äôt a requirement for me to get a job.

### 5. Interview Prep 101, what is the best resource you would recommend?

Cracking the Coding Interview + LeetCode + Pramp

### 6.	What's one piece of career/personal advice you'd give you your younger self?

Get up **early** and get things done before the rest of the day makes demands on your time.

### 7.	What are ways that you feel empowered to give back to communities and how? 

The donation matching + volunteer time matching from Microsoft is an amazing benefit that I‚Äôve used to give back to a local Boy Scout troop I‚Äôve volunteered with.

### 8. How did you decide to work at MSFT vs. another company? 
MSFT was a lot more family-friendly than most of the companies I was interviewing at, I felt like I could really grow in the team I ended up with, I identified with the vision of ‚Äúempowering others‚Äù from the mission statement

### 9. Who are your mentors? How did you select/build a relationship with mentor?  

One of the managers on a peer team. We met on his first day joining the group. I was still deciding if I should make the switch or not, and he gave me some sage wisdom. Since then, we meet up about every 2-3 weeks for coffee and to chat about whatever‚Äôs going on in work and in life. He‚Äôs become an amazing asset and a great friend. Other mentors include my parents, former church leaders and previous managers from my intern days at MSFT.

### 10. In a quick snapshot, what do you do?

I write code with Microsoft partners. For 3-5 months, our team pairs up with one of their dev teams and solve whatever interesting problem they are confronting at the time. We do a lot of open-source work (Serverless Framework, VoTT, Cloud Custodian, etc.) and travel around the world to work with these partners.

### 11. In your mind, what makes a great software engineer?

Grit, resourcefulness and humility. With those three things, most of the other skills can be acquired over time.

### 12. What does a typical day look like as a software engineer? How much time do you spend coding? In meetings? etc. What is the size of your team? How does your manager contribute to your overall success? 

My favorite kinds of days are where I have standup in the morning and the rest of the day to code. Usually, that‚Äôs not a reality. A good day is about 4-5 hours of solid coding time. Our team has 10 engineers, but we‚Äôre often split in 2 or 3 squads depending on the projects we have going at the time. My manager is actually right there in the weeds with us ‚Äì coding alongside us just like other devs on the team. He does a great job of making sure we all have opportunities to stretch and grow.

### 13. Can you give me more insight into internal mobility? (i.e. how common is it to move teams, how did you do it? Does the power of networking really work?) 

I worked as an intern in the Windows organization for 2 years, and joined this team when I came on full-time. Not a difficult change, I just talked to a manager a few times and did the OneWeek hackathon with him to see if it would be a good fit. It was üòä

### 14. If you were a former intern, what was your intern project?

2 projects ‚Äì automated identification of actionable feedback from Windows users, and another k-means clustering pipeline of windows users based on telemetry received from their machine.
 
### 15. If you weren‚Äôt a Software Engineer/Program Manager, what would you be?

Assistant to the Regional Manager of a local paper supply company

### 16. What is your favorite caf√©/restaurant in Seattle?

Chops (Bulgorrito‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like)

### 17. What is something that you do outside of work to re-energize?

Cook with my wife, play basketball with my friends or play with my 2-year old son

### 18. Describe your ideal day in Seattle?

Summer day on the beach (probably Jetty Island) with my family. Ride the bus into Seattle for a Mariners game, complete with a Seattle dog, garlic fries and post-game fireworks

### 19. What's your favorite way to eat a potato?

Sliced up and fried into 3-5 inch cubic strands of pure goodness. Otherwise known as fries. Preferably next to a burger. Preferably from Dick‚Äôs drive in

### 20. If you had a superpower, what would it be and why?

Sleep Manipulation (think Mantis from Avengers) so that I could make my kid sleep when he‚Äôs supposed to. Either that or flight
