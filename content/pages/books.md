# Books

These are some of my favorite books I've read recently. When I get some more time, I'd like to write out some of the insights I got from them, because there have been some great ones.

The first 5-10 are books that I think everyone should read. Not saying that I agree with every opinion shared in these books, but they are important ideas to consider. Each of them, in one way or another, revolve around making **deliberate** choices in how you live your everyday life.
