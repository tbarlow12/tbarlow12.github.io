# Personal Interests

When I'm not writing code, I love hanging out with my best friend. She happens to also be my wife, so that works out pretty well. I also love playing cars, tag, hide-and-seek, wrestling, etc. with our 2-year-old son. He has a little brother on the way and we couldn't be more excited.

I also love playing basketball, eating cheeseburgers and binge-watching The Office for the 27th time through (with a healthy mix of Parks and Rec). I can quote The Sandlot start to finish, and can rattle off most of John Stockton's career stat line.
