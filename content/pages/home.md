# About Me

## I'm Tanner Barlow, and I love to write code.

I've really enjoyed working in open-source as a part of my job as a Software Engineer at Microsoft and have had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects. I'm most passionate about building scalable microservices (often times using Serverless technologies) as well as developer tools. Lately, I've been working a lot with Node.js (specifically, TypeScript) and Python, but also enjoy working with C#, Java and pretty much any other language you can think of. I love writing software to make my life and the lives of others easier. I'm a big fan of cheeseburgers, basketball (Go Jazz) and audiobooks. Feel free to contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/tbarlow12) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerbarlow/) with any other questions.
