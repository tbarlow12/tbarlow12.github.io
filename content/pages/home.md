# About Me

## I'm Tanner Barlow, and I love to write code.

I've really enjoyed working in open-source as a part of my job as a Software Engineer at Microsoft and have had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects. I'm interested in building developer tools and anything makes someone else's life easier. Lately, I've been working a lot with Node.js (specifically, TypeScript) and Python, but also enjoy working with C#, Java and pretty much any other language you can think of. I'm a big fan of cheeseburgers, basketball (Go Jazz) and audiobooks, especially those about productivity. Feel free to contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/tbarlow12) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerbarlow/) with any other questions.
