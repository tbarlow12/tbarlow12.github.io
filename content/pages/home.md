# About Me

## I'm Tanner Barlow, and I love to write code.

I've really enjoyed the breadth of experience I've gained as a software engineer on the Commercial Software Engineering team at Microsoft, particularly the time spent building out developer tools and scalable microservices. I'm an unabashed fanboy of serverless (both the concept and the framework), dependency injection, design patterns, git aliases and more. I've loved working with C# & .NET Core, Node.js (specifically, TypeScript), Python, Java and pretty much any other language

I'm a big fan of cheeseburgers (the Jalape√±o Cheeseburger from Taggart's Grill in Morgan, UT is my current favorite), basketball (Go Jazz) and [audiobooks](#/blog/books), especially those about productivity. Feel free to contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/tbarlow12) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerbarlow/) with any other questions.

I hope you enjoy playing around with the integrated terminal below (run `help` to see available commands). Use it as your navigation around my site, or just use the links to my left. Thanks for visiting!
