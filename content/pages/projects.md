## Contributions to Popular Open-Source Projects

#### Serverless Framework

The Serverless framework is a CLI tool for deploying Serverless applications. The support for the [Azure Functions plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions) was lacking (hadn't been a code commit in ~2 years), and there were several companies using Azure that were interesting in using the framework to deploy their workflows. Our team re-wrote the existing plugin to account for changes to Azure Functions and make the tool more robust for enterprise use. This has been one of my favorite projects that I have been involved in.

#### VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool)

[VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT) is a popular open-source tool for the labeling of image and video data for computer vision model training. Our team [re-wrote the application](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to make it more extensible and reliable, as well as add many features that didn't previously exist.
